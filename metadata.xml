[h1]Wiki:[/h1]
Joseph MOD has full documentation through [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836319872]External Item Descriptions[/url] in English and Chinese, and throuhg the [url=https://isaacguru.com/mod/joseph]Isaacguru Website[/url] (under construction*), though if you want to enjoy the mod to the fullest, it's recommended to play without EID at first to have fun exploring each unique and individual card enchant! All enchants were created thoughtfully to be intuitive and quick to understand, but as always, feel free to play however you like!


[h1]REPENTOGON[/h1] 
This MOD was made possible by the hundreds of new modding features provided by [url=https://repentogon.com/]REPENTOGON![/url] As such, you will need to download and install it in order to play Joseph. This means that Joseph MOD is currently incompatible with the Repentance+ DLC until Repentogon is updated for it, however you can still easily disable the dlc in the game's properties to enjoy Joseph at any time!
